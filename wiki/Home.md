# Spatial Audio Extended — Wiki

> **Version 3.0.0** · by [danikakes](https://github.com/danikakes) · Godot 4.x

**Spatial Audio Extended** is an advanced, drop-in replacement for Godot's built-in `AudioStreamPlayer3D` that adds physically-inspired, real-time spatial audio effects to your 3D games.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Volume Attenuation** | Multiple falloff curves (Linear, Logarithmic, Inverse, Natural Sound, and user-defined) with configurable inner/outer radii |
| **Room Size Reverb** | Omni-directional raycasts estimate room size and apply reverb automatically |
| **Wall Occlusion** | Multi-wall detection with material-based lowpass filtering and volume reduction |
| **Air Absorption** | Distance-based high-frequency rolloff for realism at range |
| **Sound Speed Delay** | Realistic propagation delay for one-shot sounds (gunshots, explosions, etc.) |
| **Acoustic Materials** | Physics-based surface properties (absorption, scattering, transmission) with 11 built-in presets |
| **Reflection Navigation Agent (Experimental)** | `SpatialReflectionNavigationAgent3D` routes reflected proxy audio around corners in full 3D space |
| **Debug Overlay** | Runtime HUD, in-editor ray visualisation, radius wireframes, and A/B effect toggle |
| **Rich Signals** | Zone transitions, occlusion, reverb, air absorption, playback, and diagnostics |
