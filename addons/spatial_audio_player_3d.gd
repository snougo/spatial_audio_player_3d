class_name SpatialAudioPlayer3D
## `SpatialAudioPlayer3D` is an advanced, drop-in replacement for Godot's [AudioStreamPlayer3D] that provides physically-inspired, real-time spatial audio effects for immersive 3D games.
##
## Features:
## - Customizable distance attenuation with multiple falloff curves, inner/falloff radii, and user-defined curves.
## - Real-time room size and reverb estimation using omni-directional raycasts, with support for surface absorption and reflections.
## - Wall occlusion simulation with multi-wall detection, lowpass filtering, and volume reduction, including material-based transmission and absorption.
## - Air absorption (distance-based high-frequency rolloff) with linear or logarithmic scaling.
## - Sound speed delay for realistic propagation of one-shot sounds.
## - Debug overlay and runtime visualization tools for rays, radii, and playback state.
## - Rich signal set for zone transitions, occlusion, reverb, air absorption, playback, and diagnostics.
## - All key parameters are exposed as exports for easy tuning in the Godot editor.
##
## Usage:
## - Add this node in place of [AudioStreamPlayer3D] for any 3D sound that needs advanced spatialization.
## - Configure attenuation, reverb, occlusion, and debug options via the Inspector.
## - Connect to signals for gameplay, analytics, or UI feedback on spatial audio events.
##
## [b]Key inherited parameters to be aware of:[/b][br]
## - [param volume_db]: Managed internally — editing it directly has no effect.[br]
## - [param max_db]: Controls the maximum loudness of the stream.[br]
## - [param unit_size]: The radius at which the sound plays at full volume.[br]
## - [param max_distance]: The furthest distance at which the sound is audible. Should be equal to or greater than [param max_raycast_distance].[br]
